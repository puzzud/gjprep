# gjunity
A Unity project to house various logic to prepare for a game jam.
 
**Development**
 - For improved Unity YAML format file merging during conflicts, it is necessary to set an environment variable called **UNITY_HOME** to the path to which Unity was installed. This project's local **.gitconfig** file is set up to use Unity's UnityYAMLMerge utility to handle file merging, particularly files which use its YAML format (Scene and Meta files).
